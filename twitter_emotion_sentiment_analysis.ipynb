It will be most accurate on tweets lowercased and stripped of punctuations, and user handles will probably be meaningless. The model has been trained on tweets up to 2021, so it will be able to handle a wide vernacular. It will not perform well on language clusters that have shifted away from the 2018-2021 norm.\n",

Allow the colab to access your personal google account. The most likely error to occur is that your xlsx has different column names than the dataframe column names used. You will need to download the updated data from the left side bar upon conclusion of the code.\n",
